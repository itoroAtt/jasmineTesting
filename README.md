Itoro Akpan-Iquot's Jasmine Tests for P6
===============================

Instructions for running the test suites:

1) Load index.html.  You should see a list of feeds displayed.  Click the menu item (top left) to load other available feeds.

2) Below the feeds, you should see a Jasmine suite of tests.  There should be 7 tests in all - 1 test that came by default and 6 other tests that I wrote

3) If all tests have passed, the section should be green.  If it is green, feel free to edit any of the tests to make it fail, thus changing the color of the test area from green to red (refer to #4 below

4) All tests are in the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.  Comments accompanying the tests are self-explanatory

5) For these tests, I used what I learned via the course videos, udacity's discussion forum and stackoverflow.com
